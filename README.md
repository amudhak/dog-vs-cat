# Dog vs. Cat Image Classification

Training a neural network to be able to identify and differentiate between images of dogs and cats. This time I took it a step further and created the model myself, rather than fine-tuning a pre-trained one. 

### How to run yourself

1. git clone the repository
2. cmd jupyter lab in the appropriate directory

NOTE: Some packages may be necessary in order to preprocess the data, and split it into the training, testing, and validation sets.

### To Do

The model might be overfitting right now. Training was cut off early of 10 epochs, with an accuracy of 99% but testing accuracy is only about 70%. Look into simplifying the model as well as some regularization techniques.
